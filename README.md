This repository documents my work for the "RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program." It's a hands-on journey where I'm learning to design a complete System-on-Chip (SoC) from start to finish, with the ultimate goal of creating a real, physical RISC-V board.

This project covers the full VLSI design flow, from initial RTL coding and validation all the way to physical layout, timing closure, and finally, generating the final file needed for fabrication. My progress is tracked weekly, and all the work here is my own. This repository is a reflection of my commitment to learning and completing each phase of the design process.
